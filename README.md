# 🛡️ Toxic Content Moderation with AI  
**Case Study: Reducing Harassment & Abuse in Social Platforms using NLP**

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Harassment and abusive comments are a critical problem on social media platforms like YouTube, Twitter (X), and Reddit.  
Current moderation is **manual, reactive, and inconsistent**, leading to:  
- Negative user experience 😡  
- Creator churn 😔  
- Low brand trust 🛑  

**Goal:** Build an AI-assisted moderation system to auto-detect and flag toxic comments, reducing abuse visibility by 70%.

## 👤 User Personas  

1. **Neha, 24, YouTuber**  
   - Faces abusive comments daily.  
   - Wants a safer environment for herself & her audience.  

2. **Raj, 29, Community Moderator**  
   - Manages 10k+ forum members.  
   - Needs automated help to filter toxic content without false positives.  

---

## 🗺️ Current Flow (Issue)  
1. User posts abusive comment.  
2. Comment stays visible until reported.  
3. Manual review → Delayed removal.  
4. Victims suffer harm → Negative brand trust.

## 💡 Proposed Solution: AI Toxicity Filter  

- **NLP Model (BERT / Perspective API / HuggingFace)** detects toxicity levels:  
  - Hate Speech  
  - Harassment  
  - Profanity  
  - Threats  

- **Real-time flagging**: Hide comment + notify moderator.  
- **Confidence Thresholds**:  
  - >90% → Auto-hide immediately.  
  - 70–90% → Send to moderation queue.  
  - <70% → Visible, but flagged for learning.  

### Features  
✅ Multi-language support (English + Hindi/vernacular).  
✅ Dashboard for moderators to approve/reject flagged items.  
✅ Continuous learning (model improves from moderator feedback).
